video_0.sh
This is the video_0.sh program by Virtual Pilot Light. It is to be used with the video video_0.sh with the YouTube platform. This is a BASH script. This is to be done on personal computers, as some content may be considered NSFW. Use One Tab. Git clone the repo on your own hard drive. Run the script. This is the only acceptable way to enjoy my media. Further questions should be aimed at the appropriate sources. I.E. do the research || don't speak. 
video_0.sh is sutable for Linux Operation Systems (maybe?) whereas video_0_w.sh is sutable for windows 11 pro Operating System.
