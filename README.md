This is a repo for the scripts that accompany my videos. 

Use at your own discretion!!!

#### This entails the order of operations for the video_vists

You must install firefox if you don't already have it installed. (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) is necessary for the viewing of video_vists regardless of your Operating System, please make it your default browser & uninstall chrome for affective viewing of my art. Please add the addon One Tab https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/ & allow for auto play https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay#w_always-allow-or-block-media-autoplay . Other suggested addons are Privacy Badger https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/ & uBlock (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search). 

 

video_0.sh
==========
This is the video_0.sh program by Virtual Pilot Light. It is to be used with the video video_0.sh with the YouTube platform. This is a BASH script. This is to be done on personal computers, as some content may be considered NSFW. Use One Tab. Git clone the repo on your own hard drive. Run the script. This is the only acceptable way to enjoy my media. Further questions should be aimed at the appropriate sources. I.E. do the research || don't speak. 
video_0.sh is sutable for Linux Operation Systems (maybe?) whereas video_0_w.sh is sutable for windows 11 pro Operating System.
