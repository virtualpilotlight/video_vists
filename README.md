# video_vists
This is a repo for the scripts that accompany my videos. 

Use at your own discretion!!! 
-----------------------------

#### This entails the order of operations for the video_vists

You must install Firefox Browser. If you don't already have it installed Firefox Browser can be installed here (https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) is necessary for the viewing of video_vists regardless of your OS (Operating System). Make Firefox Browser your default web browser & uninstall chrome for affective viewing of my art. Please add the addon One Tab https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/ & allow for auto play https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/block-autoplay#w_always-allow-or-block-media-autoplay . 
Other suggested addons include: 
Privacy Badger https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/ - blocks tracking 
uBlock (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) - blocks ads
Read Allowd (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/read-aloud/) - read text allowed
simple translate (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-translate/) translate text to or from other languages 

###### smart people take notes. 

These are the insrtuctions for running my scripts. Below is the viewing order. The scripts have accompanyment on the YouTube platform & elsewhere on the net. These are BASH scripts. This is to be done on personal computers, as some content may be considered NSFW. Use One Tab. Git clone the repo on your own hard drive. Run the script. This is the only acceptable way to enjoy my media. Further questions should be aimed at the appropriate sources. I.E. do the research || don't speak. 
Scripts labeled as .sh are sutable for Linux Operation Systems (maybe?) whereas scripts labled _w.sh is sutable for windows 11 pro Operating System.
