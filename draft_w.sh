# I need like libraries or something anything to sort sets of related data
# I want like the scrip to run & passphrases to be typed to console to open related tabs
# like ask the player their name: take the name, ask them if they are ready if they type yes open the video.
# I want like the pause to be a part of the experience
# I guess it could start with text on screen for what needs to be imput in the scrip
# like with reality TV the scrip is written after the video.
# I need like if / then & loops. 

# time stamp leaves off at 4:21 for first video, 
# I need to go back and do the links for seccond section.
# seccond time stamp leaves off at 6:32
